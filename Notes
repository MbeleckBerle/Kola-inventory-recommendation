Food balances (often called Food Balance Sheets, or FBS) are comprehensive statistical reports that show the supply and use of food in a country over a specific period—usually one year.

They are produced by organizations like the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) to help governments, researchers, and policymakers understand food availability, consumption, and production patterns.
