Food balances (often called Food Balance Sheets, or FBS) are comprehensive statistical reports that show the supply and use of food in a country over a specific period—usually one year.

They are produced by organizations like the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) to help governments, researchers, and policymakers understand food availability, consumption, and production patterns.

A food balance tracks how much food is produced, imported, exported, used, and consumed within a country.


If a country produces 1,000,000 tonnes of rice, imports 200,000, exports 100,000, and loses 50,000 in storage — the food balance for rice will show how much rice remains for people to eat and how that translates to calories per person.


💡 Why It Matters:

Food balances are used to:

Monitor food security and nutrition trends

Inform agricultural policies

Track dietary shifts (e.g., more meat or processed foods)

Support international comparisons of food systems
